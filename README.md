My summarization app is a Streamlit application that allows users to summarize or generate questions and answers from a PDF file using LangChain.

It is a web-based application that uses the LangChain library to perform the summarization and question answering tasks. LangChain is a framework for developing applications powered by large language models. It provides a number of pre-built chains for tasks such as summarization, question answering, translation, and code generation.

The app works by first loading the PDF file and splitting it into pages. Then, it presents the user with four options for selecting pages: Single page, Page range, Overall Summary, and Question. Depending on the user's selection, it performs the corresponding summarization or question answering task using LangChain.

For summarization, the app uses the pre-trained summarization chain from LangChain. This chain has been trained on a large corpus of text and code, and it has been shown to be effective at generating accurate and informative summaries.

For question answering, the app uses the pre-trained question answering chain from LangChain. This chain has been trained on a large corpus of text and code, and it is able to generate answers to questions that are not directly answered in the text.

The results of the summarization or question answering task are then displayed to the user.

The app is still under development, but it has the potential to be a valuable tool for anyone who needs to summarize or generate questions and answers from PDF files.
